#Least - an Octopress theme

Take Octopress's default, "Classic" theme. Remove the sidebar, icons, background textures, sharing options, post meta data, revise the index page, and you're left with Least.

The only added feature is the ability to set an `article_image` in a post's YAML front matter and it will beautifully display at the top of the post's page.

    article_image: banana.png
    
The image displayed for the post is then loaded from source/images/posts/banana.png

[Gestaltism](http://gestaltism.com/) is an example of this theme in action.
